                    <p>
                        My name is Juan "Jay" Hernandez. I was born and raised in Chicago. I have been in IT for 14+ years. 
                        I started exploring the idea of coding last summer and followed a few videos online. 
                        A few months back the company I was working for underwent an organizational restructure. 
                        I looked at this as an opportunity to do a bootcamp and learn a new skill set. 
                        I've always been curious about how things work. In my free time; I like to do volunteer work, be outdoors, and travel.
